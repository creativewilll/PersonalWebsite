# Deployment Fixes for williamspurlock.com

## Problems Fixed

The following issues were identified and fixed in the deployed website:

1. **Form Submission CORS Issues**
   - Problem: n8n webhook submissions failing due to CORS restrictions when hosted on Cloudflare Pages
   - Solution: Implemented multiple submission methods with fallbacks
   
2. **Calendly Widget Not Loading**
   - Problem: Calendly script loading inconsistently in production environment
   - Solution: Implemented dynamic Calendly script loading with fallbacks

## Implementation Details

### 1. Form Submission Improvements

The form submission now works through multiple approaches:

- **Direct API call**: Primary attempt to submit directly to n8n
- **Form POST method**: Secondary fallback using standard form submission
- **Local Storage backup**: Tertiary fallback to store form data locally

This ensures users can always submit forms even if networking issues occur.

### 2. Calendly Widget Fixes

Implemented a robust Calendly loading system:

- Dynamically loads Calendly scripts when needed
- Checks if Calendly is already loaded before attempting to use it
- Provides a fallback direct link if widget initialization fails

### 3. CORS and Security Configuration

Added proper CORS headers in Cloudflare Pages configuration:

- **_headers file**: Added to the deployment to instruct Cloudflare on proper CORS settings
- **Content Security Policy**: Updated to allow connections to n8n.spurlocksolutions.ai and Calendly

## How to Verify Fixes

### Testing Form Submission

1. Open the deployed site
2. Click "Start Your Project"
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check for success message
5. Verify in n8n that form data was received

### Testing Calendly

1. Open the deployed site
2. Click on "Schedule Now" button
3. Verify that Calendly widget opens properly
4. If it fails, it should open Calendly in a new tab as fallback

## Troubleshooting

### If Form Submission Still Fails

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console for error messages
3. Try the following fixes:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try a different browser
   - Check if n8n.spurlocksolutions.ai is accessible
   - Verify the webhook endpoint is still active in n8n

### If Calendly Still Doesn't Load

1. Check Console for Calendly-related errors
2. Ensure assets.calendly.com is not blocked by firewall/security tools
3. Try manually visiting your Calendly page: https://calendly.com/spurlocksolutionsai/implementing-intelligence

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Multiple Submission Methods**: The form tries three different methods to ensure data is captured. If the main method fails, it falls back to alternate approaches.

2. **Dynamic Script Loading**: Calendly scripts are loaded on-demand when the Contact component is visible, rather than in the document head.

3. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers are set in the Cloudflare Pages configuration via the _headers file.

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging is added throughout the application.

5. **Local Storage Backup**: Form data is saved to local storage as a last resort if all other submission methods fail.
